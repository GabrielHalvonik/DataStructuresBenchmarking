# Benchmarking of Data Structures in C++

## Overview

Structures benchmarking is semester project for the school subject [Data Structures and Algorithms](https://vzdelavanie.uniza.sk/vzdelavanie/planinfo.php?kod=274661&lng=sk "Data Structures and Algorithms").
 The goal wasto program and experimentally compare the performance of different implementations of data structures.

The structures and the test application are written in C ++ with manual memory management.
[Qt Framework](http://www.qt.io "Qt Framework") (v5.15) was used for better and more convenient testing and visualization.
